understnad how shop.jsx, productCard.jsx and products.js works:

product.js has all of the products in a dictionary. so i can use props.

in productCard.jsx i have the structure of the items. i import Product.js, the img and title, etc.
with the import im able to dynamically change the liustings just within the js file and not have 
to change the html itself. and dont need repetive html code, just the array.
